# GOV-C2-046 — Municipal Evacuation Shelter Accessibility Needs Triage & Resource Allocation Planning Agent

> **Category**: Cat 2 (domain workflow (a job to be done))
> **Industry**: Government

## Overview

Given an intake of evacuation shelters — each with capacity, occupancy, facility features and the support notes of its occupants — plus an incident id, the agent drafts an allocation and escalation plan: it drops records whose provenance is outside the caller's authorised list, classifies occupant support and medical notes into an accessibility-needs taxonomy (wheelchair, medical care, sensory, cognitive, language, infant, elderly), scores supply, staffing and transfer options against those needs and facility constraints, and synthesises prioritised allocations and escalations with citations. Classification and ranking are deterministic taxonomy and threshold rules — no LLM is used. Low-confidence findings, data gaps and resource contention produce escalations only, with no allocation emitted; personal data and My Number values are redacted; an intake with no authorised records gets an out-of-scope answer; and the plan is marked DRAFT. The taxonomy and resource-option reference shipped here are a small seeded sample — replace them with your own.

This is an agent template built with the **AGENTIC STAR** development platform and the
**AgentCore Framework**. It is intended to be taken as a starting point: fork it, adapt it to
your own data and policies, and run it inside your own AGENTIC STAR deployment.

## Requirements

**This template does not run standalone.** It requires:

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **AGENTIC STAR platform** | The agent connects to the platform at start-up. Without it, start-up fails immediately (see *Behaviour without the platform* below). Deployment guides and API documentation: [AGENTIC STAR Developers](https://developers.fd.agenticstar.tm.softbank.jp/) |
| **AgentCore Framework** (`agenticstar-agentcore`) | Installed from PyPI as a dependency. |
| Python | 3.11 or later (`requires-python = ">=3.11"`) |

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Behaviour without the platform

The framework is designed to run **only** on AGENTIC STAR. There is no fallback or degraded
mode. If the platform is unreachable or the SDK version does not match, the agent raises
`PlatformRequired` during graph compile / start-up preflight rather than starting in a partially
working state. This is intentional — a half-running agent is worse than one that refuses to start.

## Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests run without a platform connection. Running the agent itself does not.

## Project Structure

```
src/          agent implementation (nodes, services, schemas)
tests/        unit, integration and boundary tests
config/       agent configuration
docs/         design and operational documentation
```

See `docs/02_design.md` for the design and `docs/03_test_spec.md` for the test specification.

## Customising

1. Adjust `config/` for your own environment and policies.
2. Replace the knowledge sources and sample data with your own.
3. Review the node implementations under `src/nodes/` for domain-specific logic.
4. Re-run the test suite.
